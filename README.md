Black Hole Light Bending Simulation

Abstract
This project simulates the trajectory of light near a Schwarzschild black hole using Python. It demonstrates the progression from classical Newtonian physics to General Relativity, highlighting both numerical methods and physical insights. The simulations show how light bends under gravity, the limitations of naive numerical methods, and the importance of stable integration.

Matplotlib for plotting and animation

Key Takeaways:

Light follows null geodesics in curved spacetime

Strong gravitational fields require both correct physics and stable numerical methods

PHASE 4 — PHYSICAL VERIFICATION (PHOTON SPHERE @ 1.5 Rₛ)

Scientific question:
“Can I discover a General Relativity prediction numerically?”

What you implement:

Multiple light rays with varying impact parameters

Detection of which rays are captured vs. which escape

Identification of the critical radius where light forms unstable circular orbits

What you demonstrate:

Photon sphere exists at 1.5 Rₛ around a Schwarzschild black hole

Captured rays (red) vs. escaped rays (blue) are clearly visible

Animation shows real-time bending and capture near the black hole

Fate distribution chart shows counts of captured vs. escaped rays

End-state:
Code:

What this proves:

You did not assume the photon sphere; it is numerically verified

Strong-field behavior of light around a black hole is captured accurately


Phase 5 — Strong-Field Rotation (Kerr Black Hole) (Optional Extension)
Scientific Question

What changes in light trajectories when spacetime itself rotates?

This phase extends the Schwarzschild (non-rotating) black hole to a rotating Kerr black hole, allowing investigation of frame dragging and rotational asymmetry in photon motion.

Physical Background

In Kerr spacetime:

The black hole has angular momentum.

Spacetime is dragged around the rotating mass (Lense–Thirring effect).

Photon paths depend on whether they move with (prograde) or against (retrograde) the rotation.

Unlike Schwarzschild geometry, light trajectories are no longer symmetric.

What Is Implemented

Simplified Kerr photon equations (equatorial plane)

Single-ray and multi-ray simulations

RK4 numerical integrator

Comparison between:

Prograde vs retrograde motion

Kerr vs Schwarzschild trajectories

Visual Outputs

Saved in data/:

Kerr single-ray trajectory

Shows light bending asymmetrically around a rotating black hole

Event horizon and ergosphere are marked

Prograde vs Retrograde comparison

Prograde rays curve more strongly

Retrograde rays resist bending due to opposite rotation

Kerr vs Schwarzschild comparison

Schwarzschild: symmetric bending

Kerr: skewed, rotation-dependent bending

Multiple photon trajectories

Different impact parameters

Clear separation of paths caused by frame dragging

Animation

Time evolution of photon motion

Frame dragging visible as rotational distortion of trajectories

End State

What This Phase Demonstrates

Extension from static to rotating spacetime

Numerical handling of strong-field relativistic effects

Physical understanding of:

Frame dragging

Ergosphere

Rotation-induced asymmetry

Willingness to explore beyond the minimal model

This phase is not required for correctness of the project, but it shows depth, curiosity, and strong conceptual control of General Relativity in a computational setting.
